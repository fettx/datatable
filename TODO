Next session: 
1) Make table headings work w/ the new way of doing columns (Table headings test)
2) figure out the URL
     -- need to pass two peices of info; column index of the id(s) and url string
     -- the text is taken from the curren column
3) Working on parsing out column names from sql queries (parsing_spec.rb) (parsing things like select count(foo) as bar what type is bar?
7) Test _columns (w/ underscore) individually so that we know it has the right stuff
8) THEN drop it in to the methods that use columns (w/ no underscore) and make those work
DONE -- b) making columns a hash inside of datatable
DONE -- c) remove the array version
DONE -- d) remove the set_columns thing from all of the tests

DO the client side portion of the individual column searching


June 5 TODO:
-- make it so that you can just use raw sql
-- make it so that w/ raw sql you can customize individual columns
-- make it so that w/ arel you can customize columns

-- config/initilizer for default settings

-- can't click on pagination
-- individual columns js

DataTable.config do |config|
  config.default_options = {
    :bLengthChange => true
  }
end


-- column ordering
-- Group pagination specs together
-- sql version of helpers
-- sDom
-- like for integer columns?
-- always force use of @data table (in helper)




# Error checking:

What if I get a column name wrong in the columns hash?
