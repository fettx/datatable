1) bSortable and bSearchable should be honored in the backend.  When a column
   is not sortable or searchable it should be left out of the query.  This is
   necessary because columns defined with AS can not be included in a where
   clause, example:

       SELECT order_number AS foo FROM orders WHERE foo IS NOT NULL
       ERROR:  column "foo" does not exist;

2) make it so both global search and individual column searches
   support typcasting so that those columns can be searched as
   strings, example:

       SELECT order_number FROM orders WHERE CAST(order_number as text) LIKE '%123%';

       column({:type => :string, :cast => [:order_number, :text]})

   having :cast present would force it to build any where clauses using a type cast

4) Make sure that integer search strings that evaluate to zero but are not zero don't
   get applied.  In this situation the column should not be searched.


5) rails like config/initilizer for default settings of datatable
    DataTable.config do |config|
      config.default_options = {
        :bLengthChange => true
      }
    end

6) default sort orders

7) Provide example of fnRender

8) Theming
     default (non jquery ui theme)
     jquery ui theme

9) rails generator
     add javascript to public/javascripts
     add css for default datatable theme to public/stylesheets
     add template for config/initializer/datatable.rb
     create folder app/datatables/

10) web site, readme, wiki on github

11) release 0.1 (support for rails 3.0)

THE FUTURE
  Rails 3.1
  Searching Date Ranges
  Easy Printing of Table
  Download CSV/Excel
  Reordering Columns
  Lightbox Editing
  Column ReOrdering
  maybe parse the SQL ?
  get acitve releation version to do more
  it it possible to extract the where clause from the base sql reliably?
