# Complexities
-- select concat(first_name, last_name) as name
-- joining so that you can see things
  -- e.g. see customer and and sales rep name in the table
  -- helpers that you can put in html to render form to do filtering
  -- http://www.datatables.net/release-datatables/extras/ColReorder/col_filter.html
-- multicolumn ordering
-- combining two columns

# Process
-- manually make it work for each complex case
-- make it into a class
-- make it into a gem
